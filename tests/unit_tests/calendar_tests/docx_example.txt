Introduction



This paper considers the implication of vegecultural systems of food production within a prehistoric context within Southeast Asia and contrasts this with the better described systems of plant cultivation known from the prehistory of Papua New Guinea.   In doing this we also consider the social significance of vegecultural traditions as a more than simply a method of providing food in tropical contexts but as an embedded ‘practice’ that, over millennia, had become tightly woven into indigenous cosmologies.  We consider long histories of vegeculture across Melanesia and Island Southeast Asia, primarily involving asexual propagation, transplanting, and low intensity plant management within forested environments  We argue that mosaics, or a patchwork, of human-plant interactions existed across Island Southeast Asia and into Melanesia from the Pleistocene until the late Holocene and that this had important implications for the histories of people-plant interactions and instances of phenotypic change in some plants, but its absence in others. Finally we consider what this implies for the apparent late adoption of rice as a major staple across island Southeast Asia south of Taiwan; a transformation that was structured by behavioural predispositions (habitus), domesticatory relationships (domus), including exploitation practices, and plants (after Bourdieu 1990; Hodder 1990; Denham 2004).  Rather than solely being inherited from Austronesian-speaking colonisers (Bellwood 2005), the deep antiquity of vegecultural forms of people-plant interaction did not pave the way for a new farming system and new farming technologies, and is more likely to have discouraged its adoption for many thousands of years.
